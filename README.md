Game Overview
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game with a twist. Players are provided with a riddle to solve and must guess the word by guessing letters.
Players can also request hints to help solve the puzzle. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or exceeds the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
Players get up to 3 hints and 5 incorrect guesses before the game ends. Enjoy interactive feedback, with warnings for repeated guesses. Save and run the script in Python to start playing!
